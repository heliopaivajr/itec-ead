## When to Use

- Auditing or improving PageSpeed Insights scores
- Fixing Core Web Vitals (CLS, LCP, FCP, TBT, INP)
- Optimizing site performance for any category
- Diagnosing why a score dropped or is below target
- Planning a performance optimization sprint

## Supported Stack

React 18+, Vite 5+, Next.js 14+, Tailwind CSS, Vercel, Shopify Storefront API, any SPA or SSR framework.

## Workflow: Diagnose-Fix-Validate

### Phase 0: Automated Diagnosis with Playwright

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP.** Before any code changes, run a full PageSpeed diagnosis using Playwright MCP to extract real metrics from pagespeed.web.dev.

#### Step 0.1: Run PageSpeed Analysis

Navigate to PageSpeed Insights and trigger the analysis:

```
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate -> https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis?url={SITE_URL}
```

Wait for analysis to complete (10-30 seconds):

```
mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for -> text "Desempenho" or "Performance" (timeout 60s)
```

#### Step 0.2: Capture Scores (Mobile)

Take a screenshot of the scores section:

```
mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot -> filename: pagespeed-mobile-scores.png
```

Take a snapshot to extract the actual metric values:

```
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot -> filename: pagespeed-mobile-snapshot.yml
```

Read the snapshot to extract: Performance score, FCP, LCP, TBT, CLS, Speed Index.

#### Step 0.3: Switch to Desktop and Capture

Click the "Desktop" / "Computador" tab:

```
mcp__playwright__browser_click -> ref for "Computador" or "Desktop" tab
```

Wait for desktop results, then screenshot + snapshot:

```
mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot -> filename: pagespeed-desktop-scores.png
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot -> filename: pagespeed-desktop-snapshot.yml
```

#### Step 0.4: Capture Diagnostics (scroll down for details)

For EACH tab (mobile and desktop), scroll down and capture the diagnostic sections:

1. **INSIGHTS section** - "Melhorar entrega de imagens", "Causas da troca de layout", "Use ciclos de vida eficientes de cache"
2. **DIAGNOSTICO section** - "Reduza o JavaScript nao usado", "Reduza o CSS nao usado", "Evitar tarefas longas"

Take screenshots of each expanded diagnostic:

```
mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot -> fullPage: true, filename: pagespeed-mobile-diagnostics.png
```

#### Step 0.5: Build Baseline Report

From the extracted data, produce a structured baseline:

```markdown
## Baseline Report - {URL}
Date: {date}

### Scores
| Category | Mobile | Desktop |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Performance | X | X |
| Accessibility | X | X |
| Best Practices | X | X |
| SEO | X | X |

### Core Web Vitals
| Metric | Mobile | Desktop | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| FCP | Xs | Xs | < 1.8s | OK/FAIL |
| LCP | Xs | Xs | < 2.5s | OK/FAIL |
| TBT | Xms | Xms | < 200ms | OK/FAIL |
| CLS | X | X | < 0.1 | OK/FAIL |
| SI | Xs | Xs | < 3.4s | OK/FAIL |

### Issues Found (by priority)
1. [CRITICAL] ...
2. [HIGH] ...
3. [MEDIUM] ...
```

### Phase 1: Prioritize by Impact

Fix in this order (highest impact first):

```
CLS > LCP > FCP > TBT > Speed Index
```

CLS and LCP are the two metrics that most heavily affect the Performance score. See `references/optimization-checklist.md` for specific fix patterns.

### Phase 2: Fix (one issue at a time)

Each fix = 1 atomic commit + rebuild + re-test. Never batch multiple unrelated fixes.

### Phase 3: Validate with Playwright

After deploying fixes, re-run the diagnosis:

```
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate -> https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis?url={SITE_URL}
```

Compare new scores against baseline. Repeat until target is reached.

**Important:** Wait 1-2 minutes after deploy for CDN cache propagation before re-testing.

## Playwright Diagnosis Patterns

### Pattern: Full Automated Audit

```
1. Navigate to pagespeed.web.dev/analysis?url={URL}
2. Wait for "Performance" or "Desempenho" text
3. Screenshot scores (viewport)
4. Snapshot to extract metric values
5. Click "Desktop"/"Computador" tab
6. Wait, screenshot, snapshot again
7. Scroll to diagnostics, screenshot fullPage
8. Parse all data into baseline report
```

### Pattern: Quick Score Check

```
1. Navigate to pagespeed.web.dev/analysis?url={URL}
2. Wait for results
3. Snapshot only (no screenshots)
4. Extract Performance score + CLS + LCP from snapshot text
5. Compare against previous baseline
```

### Pattern: Verify Specific Fix

```
1. Navigate to pagespeed.web.dev/analysis?url={URL}
2. Wait for results
3. Scroll to specific diagnostic section (e.g., "Causas da troca de layout")
4. Screenshot that section
5. Verify the issue is resolved (element no longer listed)
```

### Pattern: Site Functionality Check

Before and after optimization, verify the site works:

```
1. Navigate to site URL
2. Console messages (level: error) - check for errors
3. Screenshot homepage (fullPage)
4. Navigate to key pages (/produtos, /assinatura, etc.)
5. Screenshot each + check console errors
6. Resize to mobile (375x812) and repeat
```

## Optimization Checklist

For the full checklist with code patterns, see `references/optimization-checklist.md`.

### Quick Reference (by category)

**Performance (CLS):**
- Explicit width/height on ALL images
- Skeleton grids matching real layout dimensions
- min-h on dynamic sections (carousels, API-loaded content)
- `contain: layout style` on sections that load async data
- Suspense fallbacks that replicate real DOM structure

**Performance (LCP):**
- Hero with `<picture>` AVIF+WebP + `fetchPriority="high"`
- Responsive srcSet (mobile 800px vs desktop 1920px)
- Preload with separate media queries for mobile/desktop
- Resize images to 2x retina of displayed size
- NEVER use `decoding="async"` on LCP image

**Performance (FCP):**
- Non-blocking font loading (media="print" + onload trick)
- Preconnect to CDN, API, font providers
- Code splitting with React.lazy() for below-the-fold

**Performance (Bundle):**
- Remove unused UI components (grep for imports before deleting)
- Manual chunks in Vite: react-vendor, ui-vendor, query-vendor
- Verify every package in manual chunks is actually imported

**Accessibility:**
- Contrast ratio minimum 4.5:1 (WCAG AA)
- Sequential heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3 - no skipping)
- Never nest `<button>` inside `<a>`
- alt text on all images, aria-labels on interactive elements

**Best Practices:**
- 9 security headers in vercel.json (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, COOP, etc.)
- Zero console.log in production (conditional on `import.meta.env.DEV`)
- Explicit aspect-ratio via width/height + object-contain/cover

**SEO:**
- Complete meta tags (title, description, og:*, twitter:*)
- `<html lang="xx">` attribute
- Viewport meta tag

**Cache Strategy (vercel.json):**
- `/assets/(.*)` (Vite hashed): `public, max-age=31536000, immutable`
- `/images/backgrounds/(.*)`: `public, max-age=31536000, immutable`
- `/images/logos/(.*)`: `public, max-age=31536000, immutable`
- `/images/(.*)` (dynamic): `public, max-age=604800, stale-while-revalidate=86400`
- `/fonts/(.*)`: `public, max-age=31536000, immutable`
- Cache rules must be ordered specific-first, generic-last

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Vite does NOT interpolate variables in .env files** - Never use `${VAR}` inside .env values
2. **Vercel env vars must match .env** - Pull and compare with `vercel env pull`
3. **Lighthouse mobile uses 4x CPU throttling + slow 4G** - Scores will always be lower than desktop
4. **CrUX field data takes 28 days to update** - Lab data validates immediately, field data does not
5. **React SPA cannot reach 100 Performance mobile** without SSR - Document this as architectural limitation
6. **Cache headers require redeploy to take effect** - And CDN propagation takes 1-2 minutes
7. **Suspense fallback={null} causes CLS** - Always use a skeleton that matches real content dimensions
8. **Always check console errors after deploy** - Use Playwright to verify zero errors in production
